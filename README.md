# Triggerbot in c#
Hold t while standing still and don't move mouse for the triggerbot to work. For op/marshal disable center dot.

This script was mainly made for valorant, it can probably be used in cs:go aswell.

I am a beginner in c# and would appreciate any helpful feedback (even feedback about this git page).
